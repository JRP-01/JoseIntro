    <p>Greek culture stands out as my favorite culture that I\'92m not native to. They influenced human thought, creativity, and society. Greek mythology, filled with symbolic stories about gods and heroes, encourages imagination while also reflecting timeless human struggles and values.</p>\
    \
    <p>I relate to Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei because both embody curiosity, intelligence, and creativity \'97 qualities I value and try to cultivate in myself. Da Vinci\'92s work as an artist, scientist, and inventor demonstrates how his imagination drove discovery and innovation across multiple disciplines. Similarly, Galilei\'92s scientific achievements and willingness to question accepted beliefs illustrate the power of observation, critical thinking, and problem solving.</p>\

    <p>If I were a meal, I would be a sushi platter because of the precision and artistry required to prepare and arrange such a platter, much like the careful thought I put into exploring new ideas and solving problems.</p>\
    \
    <p>I feel most creative when I am in a space that allows me to explore new ideas freely, whether alone or surrounded by nature. I am able to focus without distractions, letting my curiosity guide me as I experiment and connect different concepts.</p>\
